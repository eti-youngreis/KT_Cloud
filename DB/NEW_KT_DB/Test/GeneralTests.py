    Parameters:
    storage_manager : StorageManager
        An instance of a storage manager that handles file operations. It should contain a base directory 
        where the JSON file is stored.
        
    file_name : str
        The name of the JSON file (including the extension) to be validated.
        
    expected_data : dict
        A dictionary containing the expected key-value pairs. Each key in this dictionary is compared 
        to the corresponding key in the JSON file, and an assertion is made to ensure the values match.
        
    Raises:
    AssertionError
        If any of the values in the JSON file do not match the corresponding values in the `expected_data`, 
        an AssertionError is raised with a message indicating the mismatch.'''
